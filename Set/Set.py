# Set is a collection of unordered items 
# In set alla elements must be unique and immutable
# We cant store list and dic in set becz they are mutable


# a = {1,2,3,4,"hello", "world", 1,2,"hello","goutham"}
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
# print(len(a))


# To create empty set we should use SET = {}

# S = set()
# print(type(S))

# S.add("goutham")
# print(S)


# A = {72,45,6,898,678,"goutham", "hello"}
# C = {"goutham",235,236,665,86,87,72,6,"rrrrrrrr","ttttttttttttt"}

# A.add("kumar")
# print(A)

# A.remove(72)
# print(A)

# A.pop()
# A.pop()
# A.pop()  #pops the random elements

# print(A)

# A.clear() #returns a empty set
# print(A)

# B = A.copy()
# print(B)


# print(A.intersection(C))  # returns the common elements
# print(A.union(C))  # combines the two sets and returns the elements without any dulicate values
